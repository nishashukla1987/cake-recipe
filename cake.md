    2 Bake the chocolate cake in a preheated oven for 200 degrees celsius/392 degrees fahrenhiet for 35 to 40 mins. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven, do keep a check. For baking in a convection mode of microwave oven, preheat the oven at 180 degrees celsius/356 degrees fahrenheit for 15 minutes. Then bake the cake at 180 degrees celsius /356 degree fahrenheit for the 30 to 35 minutes.
    For doneness check the cake with a toothpick. The toothpick should come out clean. Once the chocolate cake becomes warm or cools down, unmold and place it on a wired rack. 
    3 If the toothpick is sticky, then place the cake back in the oven and continue to bake for some more minutes. Before frosting let the chocolate cake cool completely.
